We use this file for storing our TODOs instead of the Github bugtracker because there seems to be no official way to export the issues there.
We don't want to rely upon Github as a single point of failure.

Critical TODOs:
- If album artist is "Various Artists", the track filenames should also contain the track artist.

Non-critical TODOs:
- We set the ReplayGain plugin to disabled even though ReplayGain is definitely a good idea. As of version 0.1 the implementation of the plugin is not suitable for our purposes: It won't tell mp3gain to use ID3v2 tags, which will make it use its default of APEv2. File a bug report for the plugin which tells the developers to use the mp3gain parameters "-s i" so mp3gain will write ID3v2 tags. Also, file a bug report for mp3gain which says that it will screw up the DATE tag if it is used with ID3v2: A date of "2012-08-20" is currently changed to "0000-08-20; 2012".
- As of 2013-03-26, I decided to set the "Maximum number of tags" for the Genre to 1. This is for player compatibility because I suppose that many players only support a single-value genre. This is especially likely since Picard will use a special character to join multiple genres into a single value instead of writing multiple GENRE tags. We should wait a year and check whether Picard supports writing multiple GENRE tags then or players support splitting a single-value genre.
- Convert file naming to to *nix: $set(discnumber,$rsearch(%album%,\\\(disc \(\\d+\)\\\)))$set(album,$rreplace(%album%,\\s\\\(disc \\d+\\\),))$if2(%albumartist%,%artist%)/($left(%date%,4)) $lower(%album%) $replace($replace($replace($replace([%releasetype%],compilation,comp),single,CDS),soundtrack,OST),[album],)/$if(%discnumber%,CD%discnumber%)/$num(%tracknumber%,2) - $lower(%title%) (%artist%)
